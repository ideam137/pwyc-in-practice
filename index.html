              Gym access falls into two general categories: <b>day passes</b> (to include punch passes) and <b>monthly
                memberships</b>. Either pass can be scaled for PWYC, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive. In
              other words, a gym could choose to offer both PWYC day passes and monthly memberships, although we
              recommend
              gyms carefully consider if there will be any financial implications of offering both access types in PWYC
              varieties simultaneously.

              PWYC prices can exist in a <b>tiered model</b>, a <b>sliding scale</b>, or incorporate
              <b>volunteerism</b>. Tiered and sliding
              scale models are mutually exclusive, while volunteerism can be incorporated into either. A tiered model is
              a set rate or rate discounts that can be applied to day passes and monthly memberships. Sliding scale
              models are true PWYC programs where the participant selects an amount they can pay for gym access. While
              uncommon, another option for gyms is to ask or require a certain number of volunteer hours from PWYC
              participants.

              Offering reduced memberships does not guarantee that a gym loses money on these memberships. Most PWYC
              participants use the program because they otherwise couldn&apos;t afford a “standard” rate, meaning that
              PWYC revenue is revenue the gym would not be receiving if they did not offer alternative payment models.
              However, PWYC programs do incur costs: staff time to design and implement programming, offering amenities
              to additional members, etc. Additionally, some owners are concerned about “closing the gap” between a PWYC
              rate and a “standard” rate, although we found this was oftentimes a perception issue rather than a true
              financial concern when considering consumer intent.
